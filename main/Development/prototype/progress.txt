Base creation of a model based on information from webpage: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html

TTD:

function for creating copying a tensor
function for filling a tensor
function for manipulating data in a tensorarray



Train models that tests different shape inputs
Train models that tests different shape sizes
Shape extraction experimentation!
The auto-encoder
helperfunction: save and load stats
helperfunction: make various visualisations
helperfunction: image processing
main that can load models, load stats and create graphs and visualisations


Prototype currently consists off:

Train test model - Done
Test a traditional CNN model - Done
Simple shape NN - started
helperFunctions - started
main - started
Converted from prototype to project
